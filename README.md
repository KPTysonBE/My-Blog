This is a project I choose to take on to help keep my full stack knowledge sharp. When I was at IntegriChain, I started to see the potential in this and I wanted to start taking it up myself. This project is meant to serve as a continuous exploration of what the full stack has to offer in terms of curating my work and my stuff from photography to music.
