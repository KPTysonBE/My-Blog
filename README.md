Lessons learned:

* Links from the resources/assets folder must be in the public folder

* Storage needs to have w permissions for others to write to it

* In order for name to be passed thru, a controller function is a possible solution (tho there should be other ways)

* Positioning in CSS matters a lot in maintaining the look of a page

* Database connections can be a pain to set up some times, required install of php5-mysql and apache reboot to get it working

* TODO: Have photography respond to the arrow keys

* TODO: Research how to get PHP to read camera/lens and other settings for each shot

* Scope during unemployment: 

    1. SQL driven as far as removing hardcoded strings

    2. POC limited on JS bells and whistles

    3. Keep PHP reasonably tidy
